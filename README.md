# DZ60 Layout
Hey there! Welcome to the configuration repo for my custom made [DZ60 Rev3.0](https://kbdfans.com/products/dz60-60-pcb) keyboard.
I use Gateron Brown switches for Alphanumeric keys and Gateron Yellow for modifier keys.

I'll try to update this README when changes will happen, but for now my configuration is as follows:

* I use CapsLock as Layer 1 which enables me to have
    * `IJKL` - for Arrow movement
    * `UO` - for PgUp and PgDown
    * `HN` - for Home and End
    * `P` - for Ins
* I use Split Right Shift so the key right to the shift gives me Layer 2
    * `[;'/` - For movement (HHKB Style)
* Bottom right modifier row have a third FN key which gives me Layer 3
    * `Esc` - Reset QMK
    * `,./` - For Music Prev,Next,Play/Pause
    * `\` - RGB Toggle

The config can be found in [dz60.json](dz60.json) and I flash it using [Via](https://www.caniusevia.com/)
